- **Groovy Soundtrack**: Original background music to keep players entertained during intense gaming sessions.
- **Leaderboard System**: Tracks high scores and allows players to compete with friends.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and enhanced development efficiency.
- **React**: To build the game interface and manage states efficiently.
- **React Hooks**: For managing game logic, such as block movement and collision detection.
- **Context API**: For global state management, such as tracking scores and levels.
- **CSS Animations**: For smooth transitions and visual effects.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing BlockBeats presented a fun challenge in implementing real-time gameplay mechanics within the constraints of React's declarative nature. Synchronizing animations and user inputs while maintaining a responsive interface required creative use of React hooks and optimization techniques. Additionally, building a robust collision detection algorithm using TypeScript allowed for a more accurate and enjoyable gaming experience.

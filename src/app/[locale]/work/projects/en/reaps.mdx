## Overview

REAPS, or the Research Ethics Approval System, was created to modernize the often cumbersome process of obtaining research ethics approval. Tailored for Institutional or Ethical Review Boards, REAPS enables users to submit applications, track their progress, and receive approvals with unparalleled efficiency. With a focus on institutional privacy, transparency, and user-centric design, REAPS has become the go-to solution for ethics approval management.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Submission Workflow**: Researchers can easily submit their protocols using a streamlined and intuitive interface, reducing submission errors and ensuring all required documentation is provided.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Applicants and reviewers have access to dashboards that provide real-time updates on application status, improving communication and transparency.
- **Customizable Approval Lifecycle**: Institutions can configure the application process to match their specific requirements, including multi-level reviews and automated notifications.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Built with robust security protocols to ensure sensitive research data remains confidential.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Institutions can access detailed analytics, including processing times, reviewer performance, and trends in application volumes.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Designed to support multiple institutions with unique configurations, ensuring flexibility for varying operational needs.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the significant challenges was creating a multi-tenant architecture that allows institutions to customize their approval processes without compromising system integrity. Another hurdle was optimizing the application to handle high submission volumes while maintaining a 10-day average protocol cycle. Through rigorous testing and user feedback, the system now supports over 890 successfully processed applications with seamless scalability.

## Outcome

REAPS has revolutionized the ethics approval process for research institutions. With an average protocol cycle of 10 days, institutions report faster decision-making without sacrificing review quality. Over 890 applications have been successfully processed, and five institutions have adopted REAPS as their primary tool for managing ethics approvals. The system has proven its value in driving collaboration, ensuring compliance, and promoting innovation in research.
